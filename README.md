Hello!

This is a simple weather website made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Open-meteo's API key is used to get the weather parameters for 6 different Indian metropolitan cities.

Cities included in the weather website: Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Kolkata

I would like to call this website "clime" 'cause it's fancy.

Displays -> Temperature, Humidity, Sunrise and Sunset time, UV index. AND random weather quotes 'cause why not? :)
